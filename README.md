# Simon-game-built-with-jQuery
this project is about a simon game built  with jQuery Javascript framework. The way te game work is that you press any key on the keyboard to start and it will show you  a tile that
you have to click on.And as you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point you're going to screw up, and it's going to tell you that youâ€™ve got it wrong
and game is over, so you can press any key to restart the game.
